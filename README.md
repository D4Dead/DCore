# DCore
DCore is a java api that allow you to code with a modular way.
The program is separated in two parts : The Core and The Artifacts.
The core basically register the artifact that you created, and make them loop until the program end.
It provide a modular way to code. I coded it because it allows me to make very organized program in java.
